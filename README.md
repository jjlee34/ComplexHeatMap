# ComplexHeatMap
This repository was made to document the creation of heat maps based off of an inflammasome gene set and 6 samples extracted from VG6 WT Naive and Treatment groups. Other gene pathways were also used. All code was run through RStudio.

For comments, please refer to SampleHeatMap. All files have near identical code but were used for different data sets.
